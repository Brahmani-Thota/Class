State Sen. Jim Gaughran and Assemblywoman Judy Griffin proposed a bill last week that would study the environmental and human health impacts of John F. Kennedy International Airport and LaGuardia Airport.
The proposed legislation would require the state Departments of Environmental Conservation and Transportation to examine and report on the effects of air traffic at the two airports.
"“The noise is excessive, harmful to humans and needs to be mitigated,” Griffin said at a Nassau County Aviation Committee news conference on May 17."
"“Although we will always endure a level of airplane noise, I am hopeful that this study will illustrate that many residents are faced with excessive noise way above the acceptable level.”"
"Gaughran, a Democrat from Northport, recalled knocking on doors during his campaign for senate."
"He said in some cases he couldn’t finish a conversation with a constituent due to the noise from low-flying planes overhead. “There are direct flight paths that go over the northern part of [the Town of] Oyster Bay,” he said referring to the cluster of incorporated villages there. "
“In those communities you feel like you can reach up and touch some of these planes. It’s a distraction.” 
"The recent rise in jet noise is partly attributable to an increase in arrivals and departures — 35 to 70 percent more because of the Port Authority’s runway project at Kennedy, which began on April 1."
The bill would require the DEC and the DOT to study plane noise levels from JFK and LaGuardia between 2020 and 2021 and report its findings to the state the following year.
"The study would also identify holding patterns and air traffic trends that may produce unprecedented noise levels and offer alternatives to the federal government to curve the problem, Gaughran said. "
The proposed legislation would require the state Departments of Environmental Conservation and Transportation to examine and report on the effects of air traffic at the two airports.
"“The noise is excessive, harmful to humans and needs to be mitigated,” Griffin said at a Nassau County Aviation Committee news conference on May 17."
"“Although we will always endure a level of airplane noise, I am hopeful that this study will illustrate that many residents are faced with excessive noise way above the acceptable level.”"
"Malvernite Elaine Miller, one of the co-founders of the aviation committee, which was formed in March, said that its main goal is to improve Nassau County residents’ quality of life. “That will have to be done through numerous ways, but especially legislation,” Miller said."
"“The effects of plane noise have been brought to the forefront, and it seems that since the formation of this group, the ball has really been rolling.”"
"Assemblyman Ed Ra said that in 2012, he helped pass legislation to facilitate what is known as a Part 150 study, which is examining the impact of plane noise in areas under the flight paths at Kennedy and LaGuardia."
"The study, he said, has led to roundtable meetings at which elected officials, community leaders and business people met with the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey to address concerns at those airports. Nassau County, Ra said, has been under-represented at those meetings. "
"“We need a true voice when it comes to aviation issues,” he said. “We need balance. We need an opportunity for our communities to enjoy their properties.”"
"In addition to the Part 150 study, NextGen, a satellite GPS technology, was also implemented in 2012. "
"It has saved $1.6 billion by reducing jets’ time in the air and their fuel use, according to the Federal Aviation Administration. Miller said, however, that it has not helped mitigate jet noise. “Since the implementation of NextGen, citizens across the county have been exposed to an intrusive assault on their lives,” she said, “due to the continual use of constricted airspace.”"
"The recent rise in jet noise is partly attributable to an increase in arrivals and departures — 35 to 70 percent more because of the Port Authority’s runway project at Kennedy, which began on April 1."
"County Legislator Howard Kopel, a Lawrence resident who represents the Five Towns, said that while he understands that living near an airport means jet noise, more should be done to address the problem. "
"“I can practically reach up and shake hands with some of the pilots,” Kopel said. “I know that we can’t move the airports, but there has to be a way that we can divert some of the traffic.”"
"Assemblywoman Michaelle Solages said that on top of the noise, she believes that jet emissions, too, are having a negative impact on the communities she serves."
"“In Elmont and Valley Stream, the asthma rates are through the roof, and so we need to ensure that our communities are well represented, which is why we’re pushing back,” Solages said."
"“People are now more cognizant about environment and how it affects your health, so we’re looking for environmental justice for our community, and we have people who want to enjoy a great quality of life.”"
"Jana Goldenberg, a co-founder of the Nassau County Aviation Committee, said that getting local elected officials behind the proposed legislation was a win for the group, and that the next step would be its passage in the Senate and Assembly. "
"“People are getting all this noise,” she said."
Johnson reiterated the unusual wind conditions.
"But he also pointed out that airlines set their schedules possibly nine months or more in advance, making it difficult to pull switches on customers."
He also cited the crowded nature of the New York region’s skies.
"“The most crowded in the world,” he said."
"“Even a few changes would necessarily impact LaGuardia, Teterboro and Newark.”"
The $355 million runway construction at JFK has begun.
"After years of pre-planning, spirited debates over timing and impact on the airlines and FAA compliance issues, the shovel hit the dirt on April 1."
"One of four major runways at JFK Airport, 13L 31R is completely shut down until November as crews replace worn, cracked and the aging runway."
"What I also want to see happen in the future, and they're starting to look at this now, is more dispersal."""
"Airplane noise has affected the quality of life for Long Islanders in recent years, residents and officials say."
Communities such as Roslyn and Floral Park have noticed a considerable increase in air traffic as the FAA has started rolling out a modernized aviation system called NextGen.
"NextGen narrowed the air traffic routes over Long Island, making them more parallel rather than V-shaped, Suozzi said."
"A Kennedy Airport runway has also been closed for repaving since the first week of April, according to the Port Authority of New York & New Jersey, which has caused even more planes to fly in the new patterns, Suozzi said.  The work is scheduled to continue until November."
"""A lot of people who don't know this issue say, 'Oh, people should know if they move near an airport, they're going to have this problem,'"" Suozzi said.  "
"""We're 20 miles from an airport."" "
Roslyn Heights resident Steve North said airplanes have made it hard for him to enjoy his home in recent months.
"Initially, those new rules were supposed to be in place this week."
"But days after Suozzi announced the plan, the FAA put the breaks on it, saying the new rules ""require additional internal evaluation."" "
That could include an environmental review and additional assessments.
There can't be any more delays.
Suozzi and other elected officials should work with the FAA to address any last-minute concerns but make sure the review is completed quickly.
"Meanwhile, more than two dozen other congressional representatives last week requested that the Government Accountability Office study how the FAA is assessing noise levels and communicating with the public during the NextGen project."
