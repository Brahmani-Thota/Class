"Few parts of the core of Central Florida are spared of air traffic, he said.",0
" “We are a busy airport,” Brown said.",0
 “There are not too many places in metropolitan Orlando where I can look up and not see an airplane.” ,0
"Brown said his expectation is that flight paths, to be managed in the future with more precise technology, will be concentrated. ",0
"“It will narrow the tracks that aircraft will fly so people who are under those tracks will see more aircraft,” Brown said.",0
" “And as the traffic grows, they will see more and more aircraft. I don’t know that that is going to be really appreciable. I can’t say that until we get to the end of the process.",0
"To that end, the FAA meetings next week will involve many informational stations that will present aerial images and proposed flight paths.",0
" According to FAA officials, those stations will have air-traffic controllers and other experts able to answer questions about what the proposed changes may mean for neighborhoods. ",0
"In another round of public meetings projected for late 2020, the FAA will bring maps of modeled noise projections in order to tell residents with more specificity what changes in air-traffic patterns may mean. ",0
FAA officials will seek public comment at the meetings next week. Arrighi said the most helpful remarks will specifically address the possible consequences of route changes.,2
The FAA plans to conduct its environmental study this summer and host another round of workshops before officially rolling out NextGen by 2021 in Florida.,2
" The changes will affect airspace across the state, and workshops are also scheduled for Orlando, Tampa and Palm Beach County. ",0
"After identifying 11 major airspaces in the United States, called metroplexes, the FAA has so far completed seven NextGen projects across the country.",0
"A proposed change to the flight paths above South Florida could turn the local airspace into a sky-high Interstate 95, according to critics of the Federal Aviation Administration’s plan to consolidate current flight paths into narrower and more concentrated bands of traffic ",1
"Members of the Miami International Airport Noise Abatement Advisory Committee, who heard the FAA’s pitch for its Next Generation Air Transportation System during a recent meeting, expressed concerns about the added noise pollution that more concentrated flight paths could pose to communities not accustomed to such intense air traffic",1
" ""The program, known as NextGen, is about halfway through a nationwide rollout but has been met by legal challenges in states like California, Arizona and Maryland"" ",0
"Noise complaints have spiked in communities near airports in the metro areas where the program has been implemented """,1
"Characterized by the agency as an “ongoing transformation of the air traffic control technology and procedures in the United States,” NextGen largely hinges on shifting the National Airspace System from ground-based radar to satellite navigation, and modifying flight paths to make them safer and more fuel efficient"" ",0
"More direct routes would also save passengers time, the FAA contends. ",0
The federal agency said NextGen will save $15.5 million in fuel and 46.1 thousand metric tons in carbon a year,2
" ""NextGen is changing how we see, navigate, and communicate in our nation’s skies,” states a press release published by the FAA"" ",2
Think of this transition like moving from paper maps to GPS when you drive your car When this happens they’re basically going to be building an I-95 in the sky I’ve been told by FAA people that they’re expecting litigation ,2
"In planning NextGen’s rollout, the federal agency identified 11 major airspaces it calls metroplexes where one or more commercial airports serve at least one major city",0
"Dark purple and orange mainlines are then superimposed on the maps of South Florida, looking like organized highways with carefully formatted exit ramps ",0
"Gilderman said the current distribution of the flight paths is equitably dispersed, and that clustering them in narrow bands will concentrate noise pollution like sunshine through a magnifying glass",2
" ""If you live under or near that purple route, you’re going to start noticing those planes"" ",1
"It’s going to be nonstop ""He predicts concerned residents in the area will follow the lead set by those from communities in Arizona, Maryland and California where NextGen flight paths have been challenged""",1
"In January, the FAA reached a tentative settlement to adjust flights out of John Wayne Airport in Orange County, California, after being sued by the governments of Newport Beach, Laguna Beach and Orange County, according to the Los Angeles Times ",2
Satellite-based routes have resulted in flights becoming more concentrated because of the more precise nature of the avigation ,1
This has generated concerns in some communities about persistent noise in specific locations ,1
"Previously, flights were more spread out because aircraft were using less precise navigation systems ",0
"She said satellite-based paths are generally “not lower,” but do concentrate air traffic in a “narrower band than conventional procedures """,0
"As for noise concerns, the FAA said it would conduct an environmental review of the program’s Florida launch in the spring of 2019""",1
Public input will be allowed during the environmental review period as well ,2
The agency said it continues to work with individual communities to explore possible solutions to their noise complaints a growth in flight operations and increased demand have also contributed to noise concerns ,2
"It is too early to tell if noise levels in South Florida would increase under the NextGen plan, the agency said",0
 The environmental review of the proposed new procedures will identify whether aircraft noise levels would change ,0
We anticipate beginning the environmental review of the proposed procedures in spring 2019 ,0
"We will offer the public the opportunity to comment on the proposals again during the environmental review, and we will review all public comments before making a final environmental determination on the procedures in 2020 ",2
We anticipate that new procedures will be available for use in 2021,0
" She said the FAA would publicize the dates and locations of public meetings pertaining to NextGen as soon as they are finalized ""Lester Sola, the director and chief executive officer of the Miami-Dade Aviation Department, said his department and the FAA have met “over the past two years” to discuss the proposal""",0
"Recently, they have worked to develop an extensive schedule of outreach workshops with the community prior to any implementation by the FAA ",0
"The FAA’s environmental assessment process, scheduled to begin in 2019, is designed to identify and address any concerns regarding noise",0
" ""It is therefore too early in the process to evaluate what impact, if any, the program could have on noise levels"" """,0
"Miami-Dade County Mayor Carlos Gimenez said it’s too early to know what effects would be faced, but we will certainly be monitoring any impacts"" ",0
"NextGen’s promises to save on fuel and travel time, however, would “be a win-win for our community ",2
"As it stands, the FAA’s Metroplex program has the potential to save energy, which is part of our County’s resiliency efforts to combat climate change I live on the River. ",2
"It is a nightmare ""Around 2 AM the Island cargo planes lumbered low over the house, barely gaining height, all the way to Miami Beach"" ",1
"During the ear deafening noise overhead you could see a long fire streak from the propeller engines tail pipes It was always a hart stopper and felt like what it must have been during the Berlin Air-Bridge ""like I commented in last week, where I live in the roads its a nightmare when we get a northerly wind, so every cold front or change of wind direction brings the arrivals over our neighborhood"" ",1
"I don't give a damn about good windows, I live in my backyard those months and its absolute hell I am going to hunt down the arrivals which make life hell when the wind blows from the north You are getting the DEPARTURES when the wind changes. Landing planes make little noise",1
