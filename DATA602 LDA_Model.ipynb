    "doc1 = \"\"\"Runway reconstruction at Kennedy Airport will reduce airplane noise in the Five Towns area during a shift of air traffic to the Valley Stream area, where residents can expect more noise through late 2019, an FAA official said Wednesday. Planes won’t be able to use Runway 13L-31R, one of JFK’s four runways, which is scheduled for closure between April and November of 2019 as pavement is stripped and replaced with gravel and 18 inches of concrete, said Andrew Brooks, a Jamaica-based regional environmental manager with the Federal Aviation Administration. “When the runway’s down for construction, the aircraft that operate there now have to go somewhere else,” Brooks said. “During that time, they’ll be shifting to other runways.” Valley Stream and North Valley Stream — with a population of about 11,000 in 3,000 households — will “temporarily see an increase in noise exposure,” he said. Five Towns communities like Cedarhurst, Lawrence and Hewlett — with a population of about 16,000 in 4,700 households — “will get some noise benefits,” Brooks said. Tens of thousands of Queens residents will also experience a shift in noise. About 30 percent of airport traffic that ordinarily uses the runway will be redistributed to the remaining runways, he said. After the construction is finished, the traffic — and the noise — would essentially return to the status quo. “It is temporary,” Brooks said. The Port Authority, the agency that runs the region’s airports, set up easels in the lobby of the Cradle of Aviation Museum in Garden City on Wednesday night, one of three public sessions, to explain the project, which will widen the runway to 200 feet from 150 feet and convert it from asphalt to longer-lasting concrete. Elaine Miller of Malverne, who helps run the group Plane Sense 4 LI, came to the museum to gather more information about the runway project and left dreading the construction. “I think our lives are going to be a living hell. I don’t know how I’m going to endure it,” she said. Miller, who has long been frustrated with the existing flight paths, said sleeping is hard as it is. “They are constant. They are low. They are loud,” Miller, a schoolteacher, said of planes overhead. “They are destroying the quality of our lives.” PORT AUTHORITY BOARD APPROVES $355 MILLION FOR REHABILITATION OF KEY JFK AIRPORT RUNWAY, ADDS HIGH-SPEED TAXIWAY TO REDUCE DELAYS Use of durable concrete instead of typical asphalt will lengthen lifespan of runway up to 40 years, compared with asphalt’s 10-12 years; New high-speed taxiway allows planes to exit runways faster and save travelers time The Port Authority’s Board of Commissioners has approved a $355 million project for the rehabilitation of Runway 13L-31R at John F. Kennedy International Airport and the addition of a new high-speed taxiway, part of a package of state-of-good-repair and system-enhancing projects to improve airport travel. The 10,000-foot-long runway, which runs east/west on the airport’s north side and handles almost half of JFK’s arriving planes, is being built with concrete for longer- term durability that will minimize future operational impacts. “Runway rehabilitation is an essential part of the Port Authority’s state-of-good-repair initiatives at its airports and our continuing efforts to ensure world-class operations,’’ said Port Authority Chairman Kevin O’Toole. “This infrastructure investment will enhance the efficiency of aircraft movements on the ground, while the use of concrete will shorten the project’s timetable and increase the lifespan of the runway.” “State-of-the-art runway and taxiway systems are essential to ensuring John F. Kennedy International remains one of the world’s most important airports,’’ said Port Authority Vice Chairman Jeffrey Lynford. The runway work is expected to generate 1,880 total jobs and an additional $140.6 million in wages, and produce nearly $385 million in economic activity over the life of the project The Port Authority is working to coordinate flight schedules and airport operations during construction with the Federal Aviation Administration and the airlines to help ensure minimal impacts on travelers. The closure of Runway 13L-31R, one of JFK’s four runways, is scheduled to begin in April 2019 and reopen with key project elements finished by the end of 2019. The construction of a new high-speed taxiway and taxiway realignment will improve efficiency of runway operations, reducing runway occupancy time per arrival by nearly six seconds on average. The time-savings are cumulative and are estimated to save passengers approximately 1,000 hours annually in delays and taxiing time, for a combined savings to airlines and passengers of about $9 million, according to FAA calculations. The runway refurbishment is part of a Port Authority program of airport infrastructure improvements focused on enhanced safety and reduced flight delays. This includes the addition of high speed taxiways at JFK and Newark Liberty International Airport and the expansion of the aeronautical operations areas. At LaGuardia the increased airfield area will mean increased maneuverability for larger planes to gates. These infrastructure improvements are being combined with technology enhancements to help reduce delays by managing arrival and departure traffic more efficiently. Valley Stream may soon be seeing — or, more accurately, hearing — up to 30 percent more air traffic, as the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey continues its work at John F. Kennedy International Airport. The authority’s board of commissioners announced on Oct. 17 that it had approved a $355 million project for the rehabilitation of JFK’s Runway 13L-31R and the addition of a high-speed taxiway, part of a package of repairs and system-enhancing projects to improve airport travel. The 10,000-foot-long runway, which extends east and west on the airport’s north side and handles almost half of its arriving planes, will be rebuilt with concrete rather than asphalt for more long-term durability. The project is scheduled to begin next April, and to be completed by November. “Runway rehabilitation is an essential part of the Port Authority’s state-of-good-repair initiatives at its airports and our continuing efforts to ensure world-class operations,’’ Port Authority Chairman Kevin O’Toole said in a news re-lease. “This infrastructure investment will enhance the efficiency of aircraft movements on the ground, while the use of concrete will shorten the project’s timetable and increase the lifespan of the runway.” But because of the project, other runways may see an increase in arrivals and departures of 35 to 70 percent, according to the Port Authority. That could mean more jet noise for Nassau County residents. “We, of course, understand that this work will be a burden on our residents and at times difficult to endure in our day-to-day lives,” Valley Stream Mayor Ed Fare said in a statement. “In light of the enhanced safety that the runway construction is expected to bring, it is an inconvenience that we anticipate will bring needed safety and life-saving improvements to the air-traveling public.” Fare added, “It is crucial that our voices be heard through the process to ensure the least amount of disruption to Valley Stream residents as possible.” Jana Goldenberg, co-chairwoman of advocacy group Plane Sense 4 Long Island, agreed, saying that there has never been so much jet noise in Nassau County. “We still have a long fight ahead of us,” Goldenberg said. “The problem is, we don’t have enough people fighting the fight.” Larry Hoppenhauer, executive director of the Town-Village Aircraft Safety & Noise Abatement Committee, said that Nassau County is underrepresented in the roundtable discussions between the Port Authority and the Federal Aviation Administration. Hoppenhauer previously told the Herald that one of his goals was to encourage more involvement on the part of federal officials. “The Port Authority and the FAA have shown commitment to those meetings, and they’re always willing to share some information,” Hoppenhauer said, “but it seems that it’s been very hard at the roundtable to get people together. I would still like to see all of those lines of communication open up.” TVASNAC’s jurisdiction includes Atlantic Beach, Cedarhurst, Lawrence, Woodsburgh, East Williston, Floral Park, Garden City, Malverne, New Hyde Park, Stewart Manor and Valley Stream. All are villages. Hoppenhauer said that JFK’s project is badly needed, but he hopes something will be done to limit jet noise. “It’s a good thing, it’s a safety thing, and I understand that this is for the betterment and improvement of JFK’s airport,” he said, “but I’d like to know what they’re going to do to mitigate the increase in traffic.” Elaine Miller, the other co-chairwoman of Plane Sense 4 Long Island, said that in order for Nassau County residents to be heard, they must make a more concerted effort to push for legislation. “I think that we’re always the forgotten child, and I think that because the airplanes are located in Queens, I think they pay more attention to that,” she said. “However, we get the same amount of air traffic, and at times, worse. It’s very disheartening to us here in Nassau County, because we feel as though there’s nothing that we can do, but we have to keep fighting.” The Port Authority was scheduled to make a presentation about the JFK Redevelopment Plan at the VFW on Merrick Road on Wednesday, after the Herald went to press. Some Nassau County residents could soon be dealing with more airplane noise overhead due to a runway renovation planned at John F. Kennedy International Airport. An information session was held Wednesday night in Garden City about the proposed changes. Officials with the Port Authority and FAA explained the asphalt on one of the runways is deteriorating. That runway happens to handle nearly half of the arrivals at JFK. The plan is to close that runway from April to the middle of November next year and replace it with concrete. Officials say during construction they expect more noise in North Valley Stream and Valley Stream because of an increase in flights overhead. Residents say they are furious. As a result, the FAA says airplane noise will temporarily reduce in the Five Towns area.

    "doc1 = \"\"\"State Sen. Jim Gaughran and Assemblywoman Judy Griffin proposed a bill last week that would study the environmental and human health impacts of John F. Kennedy International Airport and LaGuardia Airport. The proposed legislation would require the state Departments of Environmental Conservation and Transportation to examine and report on the effects of air traffic at the two airports. “The noise is excessive, harmful to humans and needs to be mitigated,” Griffin said at a Nassau County Aviation Committee news conference on May 17. “Although we will always endure a level of airplane noise, I am hopeful that this study will illustrate that many residents are faced with excessive noise way above the acceptable level.” Gaughran, a Democrat from Northport, recalled knocking on doors during his campaign for senate. He said in some cases he couldn’t finish a conversation with a constituent due to the noise from low-flying planes overhead. “There are direct flight paths that go over the northern part of [the Town of] Oyster Bay,” he said referring to the cluster of incorporated villages there. “In those communities you feel like you can reach up and touch some of these planes. It’s a distraction.” The recent rise in jet noise is partly attributable to an increase in arrivals and departures — 35 to 70 percent more because of the Port Authority’s runway project at Kennedy, which began on April 1. The bill would require the DEC and the DOT to study plane noise levels from JFK and LaGuardia between 2020 and 2021 and report its findings to the state the following year. The study would also identify holding patterns and air traffic trends that may produce unprecedented noise levels and offer alternatives to the federal government to curve the problem, Gaughran said. “We’re going to confront the federal government to fix this issue that, we see, is obvious, and create guidance to try and make some changes so these communities that are unfairly inundated with all this air traffic can get some relief,” he said. Malvernite Elaine Miller, one of the co-founders of the aviation committee, which formed in March, said that its main goal is to improve Nassau County residents’ quality of life. “That will have to be done through numerous ways, but especially legislation,” Miller said. “The effects of plane noise have been brought to the forefront, and it seems that since the formation of this group, the ball has really been rolling.” Assemblyman Ed Ra said that in 2012, he helped pass legislation to facilitate what is known as a Part 150 study, which is examining the impact of plane noise in areas under the flight paths at Kennedy and LaGuardia. The study has led to roundtable meetings at which elected officials, community leaders and business people met with the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey to address concerns at those airports. But Nassau County has been under-represented at those meetings, Ra said. An aide from Gaughran’s office said the Part 150 study does not include most of Long Island since many of the plane noise monitors that measure sound intensity there have reported average sound levels below the Federal Aviation Administration’s definition of significant noise (approximately 65 decibels). In addition to the Part 150 study, NextGen, a satellite GPS technology, was also implemented in 2012. It has saved $1.6 billion by reducing jets’ time in the air and their fuel use, according to the FAA. Miller said, however, that it has not helped mitigate jet noise. “Since the implementation of NextGen, citizens across the county have been exposed to an intrusive assault on their lives,” she said, “due to the continual use of constricted airspace.” Jana Goldenberg, another co-founder of the Nassau County Aviation Committee, said that getting local elected officials behind the proposed legislation was a win for the group, and that the next step would be its passage in the Senate and Assembly. “We don’t let grass grow under our feet,” Goldenberg said. “We’re going to work until we can live in peace and quiet and know that we’re not being killed by the toxic fumes flying over us.” State Sen. Jim Gaughran and Assemblywoman Judy Griffin, whose district encompasses Malverne, proposed a bill last week that would study the environmental and human health impacts of John F. Kennedy International Airport and LaGuardia Airport. The proposed legislation would require the state Departments of Environmental Conservation and Transportation to examine and report on the effects of air traffic at the two airports. “The noise is excessive, harmful to humans and needs to be mitigated,” Griffin said at a Nassau County Aviation Committee news conference on May 17. “Although we will always endure a level of airplane noise, I am hopeful that this study will illustrate that many residents are faced with excessive noise way above the acceptable level.” Malvernite Elaine Miller, one of the co-founders of the aviation committee, which was formed in March, said that its main goal is to improve Nassau County residents’ quality of life. “That will have to be done through numerous ways, but especially legislation,” Miller said. “The effects of plane noise have been brought to the forefront, and it seems that since the formation of this group, the ball has really been rolling.” Assemblyman Ed Ra said that in 2012, he helped pass legislation to facilitate what is known as a Part 150 study, which is examining the impact of plane noise in areas under the flight paths at Kennedy and LaGuardia. The study, he said, has led to roundtable meetings at which elected officials, community leaders and business people met with the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey to address concerns at those airports. Nassau County, Ra said, has been under-represented at those meetings. “We need a true voice when it comes to aviation issues,” he said. “We need balance. We need an opportunity for our communities to enjoy their properties.” In addition to the Part 150 study, NextGen, a satellite GPS technology, was also implemented in 2012. It has saved $1.6 billion by reducing jets’ time in the air and their fuel use, according to the Federal Aviation Administration. Miller said, however, that it has not helped mitigate jet noise. “Since the implementation of NextGen, citizens across the county have been exposed to an intrusive assault on their lives,” she said, “due to the continual use of constricted airspace.” The recent rise in jet noise is partly attributable to an increase in arrivals and departures — 35 to 70 percent more because of the Port Authority’s runway project at Kennedy, which began on April 1. County Legislator Howard Kopel, a Lawrence resident who represents the Five Towns, said that while he understands that living near an airport means jet noise, more should be done to address the problem. “I can practically reach up and shake hands with some of the pilots,” Kopel said. “I know that we can’t move the airports, but there has to be a way that we can divert some of the traffic.” Assemblywoman Michaelle Solages said that on top of the noise, she believes that jet emissions, too, are having a negative impact on the communities she serves. “In Elmont and Valley Stream, the asthma rates are through the roof, and so we need to ensure that our communities are well represented, which is why we’re pushing back,” Solages said. “People are now more cognizant about environment and how it affects your health, so we’re looking for environmental justice for our community, and we have people who want to enjoy a great quality of life.” Jana Goldenberg, a co-founder of the Nassau County Aviation Committee, said that getting local elected officials behind the proposed legislation was a win for the group, and that the next step would be its passage in the Senate and Assembly. “We don’t let grass grow under our feet,” Goldenberg said. “We’re going to work until we can live in peace and quiet and know that we’re not being killed by the toxic fumes flying over us.” The ongoing construction work at John F. Kennedy International Airport has caused issues for a portion residents living in communities close to the airport. Henry Beyer, a Woodmere resident for roughly the past 40 years, is one of those people. He wrote a Letter to the Editor on the problem. “When I first moved to Woodmere, I knew that living fairly close to JFK meant that there would be plane noise,” he wrote. “Everything has changed in the past three months, the incessant noise is unrelenting and has altered my quality of life.” Beyer noted that the plane noise is the loudest from the hours of 7 p.m. to 7 a.m., which is a big issue for him. “At times, it sounds like the planes are landing on my roof,” he told the Herald. “I would be okay if it was happening in the daytime, but the noise at night is disruptive and wakes me up.” The construction work at JFK that apparently has caused the aircraft noise increase was announced in October 2018. It includes the reconstruction and widening of runaways 13L and 31R. The work began on April 1 and is expected to be completed in November. The runways’ widths are being expanded from 150 to 200 feet, or 33 percent, to accommodate larger planes and the cost is expected to total $355 million, according to the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey. The work results in more planes arriving and departing on the remaining open runaways. The Port Authority conducted an impact study on the construction at runaways’ 13L and 31R with the Federal Aviation Administration. The FAA method of measuring airplane noise uses a metric called day-night average sound level, or DNL, which measures the total accumulation of noise measured over a 24-hour period. A 65-decibel DNL as the threshold for what the FAA considers “significant” noise. The study noted, “13,406 households and 39,038 people would be exposed to a 65-decibel DNL or higher due to the construction.” The study did not clarify how many households in Woodmere are exposed to a 65-decibel DNL. Larry Hoppenhauer is the executive director of the Town of Hempstead’s Town-Village Aircraft Safety & Noise Abatement Committee. The committee serves as a civilian watchdog agency that monitors airplane noise in the area. He noted the amount of increased airfare he thinks occurs at the other JFK runaways as result of the construction. “I’m expecting a 30 to 70 percent increase in air traffic at the other runaways from the construction,” Hoppenhauer said. “This has for sure impacted the neighborhoods surrounding JFK.” TVASNAC has received several complaints from residents on the noise. “We’ve been getting complaints from everywhere in the Town of Hempstead,” he said. “Another main reason for the noise at night is because of the cargo planes. They make a lot of noise and fly lower in the sky.”  Hoppenhauer said that TVASNAC holds monthly meetings typically on the fourth Monday of the month. He also added that Port Authority and the FAA are welcome. “We always invite them to talk with the residents,” he said. “But the FAA never seems to want to show up.” Hoppenhauer noted that Port Authority usually responds to his requests for a subject matter expert to appear at TVASNAC meetings. Noise complaints can be made to Port Authority by filling out a form online at: An ill wind —and an unusually steady south-southeasterly one at that — has residents living north and northeast of John F. Kennedy International Airport calling for some kind of relief from increased jet noise that has accompanied the start of reconstruction of Runway 13 Left-31 Right. Both the Port Authority of New York ad New Jersey, which operates JFK and LaGuardia airports, and the Federal Aviation Administration caught an earful of their own from residents last Monday at a meeting of the JFK Airport Committee. The meeting took place at the PA’s offices at JFK. The alignment of 13L-31R is west-northwest to east-southeast. It is 10,000 feet long and runs roughly parallel to Rockaway Boulevard. It closed for reconstruction on April 1, meaning that its regular takeoffs and landings had to be diverted to JFK’s remaining runways. But the start of construction also coincided with an odd change in the weather. “For most of April, winds were coming from the south or southeast,” said David Johnson of the FAA. That has meant nearly two months of an inordinate number of planes coming in from the north to land on runways 22 Left or 22 Right, which run parallel to each other on the eastern end of JFK and are oriented north-northeast to south-southwest. A spokesman for U.S. Rep. Tom Suozzi (D-Suffolk, Nassau and Queens) told the crowd that resident complaints as far north as Long Island’s Gold Coast have reached such a level that Suozzi and Rep. Kathleen Rice (D-Nassau) recently had a face-to-face sitdown with FAA and PA officials to get an explanation. A representative for Rep. Gregory Meeks (D-Queens, Nassau) told the group that the congressman also has been kept in the loop by both agencies. Yatsun Lau of the PA said the runway is being replaced with concrete rather than the initial plan to repave it with asphalt. He said that is to residents’ benefit as it shortens the construction project — 13L is scheduled to reopen on Nov. 16 — and will last 40 years as opposed to 10 for asphalt, meaning more time between construction projects. Barbara Brown, chairwoman of the committee as well as the Eastern Queens Alliance civic group, asked why some changes couldn’t be made to tweak schedules. “People are getting all this noise,” she said. Johnson reiterated the unusual wind conditions. But he also pointed out that airlines set their schedules possibly nine months or more in advance, making it difficult to pull switches on customers. He also cited the crowded nature of the New York region’s skies. “The most crowded in the world,” he said. “Even a few changes would necessarily impact LaGuardia, Teterboro and Newark.” The $355 million runway construction at JFK has begun. After years of pre-planning, spirited debates over timing and impact on the airlines and FAA compliance issues, the shovel hit the dirt on April 1. One of four major runways at JFK Airport, 13L 31R is completely shut down until November as crews replace worn, cracked and the aging runway. Aviation Director Huntley Lawrence, said the construction was necessary now to maintain safety and longevity as well fit into the overall JFK Airport redevelopment. He said “ this way this runway being constructed will last 40 years due to the type of material being used, so it’s better to get it all done now.” Prior to the planned construction there were many meetings held at the airport with airlines, terminal operators, the FAA and stakeholders. Many expressed concerns over the long time closure and possible negative impact during the summer months when severe thunderstorms could negatively impact flights. Airlines management expressed thoughts that the loss of one major runway could hamper operations causing passenger delays with one less runway. However, through the efforts of collaboration, the Port heard the concerns and was able to tweak the timeframe, scope and to maintain daily communications to mitigate problems working with the airport stakeholders and FAA. Said Rick Cotton, executive director of The Port Authority, ‘“With collaboration from our airline partners and the Federal Aviation Administration, the next eight months of continuous work on Runway 13L-31R will pay huge dividends in terms of operational safety and efficiency over the coming decades at JFK, as it represents the final phase of upgrading the four operational runways at the airport.” JFK terminal operators expressed support for the project. “The Port Authority has continued to work extensively with the airport community in preparation for the runway reconstruction, which will directly impact all terminals and airlines. All JFK terminal operators understand the importance of this critical runway work.” Evidence of the commitment to expedition the project could be seen as Over 50 work related vehicles were seen at the airport on the second day of construction. “The Port Authority recognizes the need for infrastructure upgrades to improve the customer’s flight experience and to better maintain and operate our facilities and assets,” said Port Authority Chairman Kevin O’Toole. “This project is critical to achieve those goals, and we are working to ensure minimal impact while the reconstruction is under way.” Plane noise is a fact of life in Valley Stream. Whether you live in the village or its unincorporated areas, with John F. Kennedy International Airport roughly five miles away, at any given time there are at least a dozen planes taking off or landing in the airspace overhead. But for resident Ulla Kjarval, who in recent months has been nursing a newborn at her home, the last few weeks have been particularly bad. “Maybe it’s because I’m home and up at night?” she said, wondering if her specific situation had made her sensitive to the roaring sound of jets overhead. It hasn’t. “I’m afraid the news is not good,” reported Larry Hoppenhauer, executive director of the Town of Hempstead’s Town-Village Aircraft Safety & Noise Abatement Committee, a civilian watchdog agency that monitors airplane noise in the area. That’s because starting April 1, the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, which operates JFK, embarked on a $355 million reconstruction and widening of two of the airport’s main runways, closing them for eight months until the project’s scheduled completion in November. As a result, flights are now being rerouted to JFK’s remaining three runways, and residents of western Valley Stream can expect to hear more airplane noise for the project’s duration. By Hoppenhauer’s estimates, JFK’s remaining runways could see anywhere from a 30 to 70 percent increase in plane traffic, which means the neighborhoods under the approach and takeoff paths for those runways will experience increased noise. The runways under construction, 13L and 31R, run parallel east and west, leaving runways 4R and 22L — whose landing and takeoff patterns run above central Valley Stream — to handle more traffic, extending the radius and intensity of noise that will affect residents below well into North Valley Stream, according to an environmental impact report released by the Port Authority. Where do the planes go? The Port Authority estimated that roughly 860 arrivals would be rerouted from the runways under construction to others at JFK, with an undetermined number of departures to be transferred to other runways as well. Valley Streamers are being hit with the brunt of the transferred arrivals, as runways 4R and 22L, which lie southwest of the village, were estimated to experience as much as 35 percent of the arrival traffic being transferred from the runways under construction. They will, however, see no increase in departure traffic, with plane takeoffs being directed south. The purpose of the reworked flight paths, according to the Port Authority report, is to reduce the impact on JFK’s capacity during bad weather. “The FAA has indicated that the temporary flight procedure would only be used during the construction period,” it added. Additionally, the wider runways will accommodate the Airbus A380, the largest airliner in service in the world. The report indicates that the inclusion of the A380 in JFK’s fleet makeup will not lead to increased noise once construction is complete. It’s all about the decibels. The Federal Aviation Administration’s standard method of measuring airplane noise uses a metric called day-night average sound level, or DNL, which measures the total accumulation of noise measured over a 24-hour period. The FAA regards a 65-decibel DNL as its threshold for what it considers “significant” noise. According to the Port Authority’s impact study, 13,406 households and 39,038 people would be exposed to a 65-decibel DNL or higher due to the construction. In addition to average homes, 27 noise-sensitive sites, which include facilities such as hospitals, schools, houses of worship and libraries, may be exposed to “significant” plane noise that they had not experienced previously, and 30 sites that already experience plane noise will hear even more. Conversely, because of a lack of traffic from the runways under construction, 16 noise-sensitive sites that normally experience plane noise are expected to see a temporary reprieve during construction. The report maintains that the additional noise Valley Streamers are experiencing is necessary to keep JFK running smoothly. “No reasonable runway operations are available that might avoid such temporary noise impacts while maintaining efficient operations at JFK during construction,” it read. Valley Streamers, however, can expect some normalcy to return in the coming months, as runways 13L and 31R become partially operational over the summer while the project moves on to reconstructing adjacent taxiways. By November, the plane noise is expected to return to normal levels. For residents like Kjarval, it can’t come soon enough, but she expressed relief that the disruptions would only be for a few months. “It’s nice to know it’s temporary,” she said. The project is estimated to cost $355 million, and is expected to last eight months. The asphalt runways are being reconstructed using concrete to reduce maintenance costs and extend their operational life from 10 to 40 years. The runways’ widths are being expanded from 150 to 200 feet, or 33 percent, to accommodate larger planes, chiefly the Airbus A380. Runway lights and electronic landing systems will be updated. The current lighting systems date back to 1992.

Folks: 13L/31R is a single runway. John F. Kennedy International Airport has closed one of its four runways as it gears up for a massive reconstruction project. The project, estimated to cost $355 million, will include the installation of new lights, signs, cables and navigational aids to help the airport meet new safety standards. The goal is to rebuild what is considered JFK’s \"last outdated runway,\" said Port Authority executive director Rick Cotton, in a statement detailing the forthcoming work. The electrical lighting system was originally installed in 1993, Cotton added. The runway will be closed from now through November during which time it will be extended and widened by 33 percent. The airport says it will use concrete to reconstruct the landing strip, which will extend its useful life to 40 years rather than the eight to 12 years seen with asphalt. Among the challenges of the project is redirecting traffic. This particular runway, 13L-31R, is about 10,000 feet long and handles roughly one-third of JFK's arrivals. It accounts for more than 61 million customers annually and more than 455,000 flights a year.JFK, as New York Business Journal previously has reported, has some of the world's busiest domestic and international routes. The longest delays are expected during peak travel times, between 8:30 a.m. and 9:30 a.m. and between 5:30 p.m. and 6:30 p.m daily. Other airports servicing New York City, including Newark Liberty International Airport in New Jersey, may be faced with additional traffic and delays as flights from JFK are diverted. To handle the changes, JFK is collaborating with the Federal Aviation Administration to develop a plan to manage aircraft traffic while the runway is closed. “The Port Authority recognizes the need for infrastructure upgrades to improve the customer’s flight experience and to better maintain and operate our facilities and assets,\" said Port Authority Chairman Kevin O’Toole, in the statement released about the project. \"This project is critical to achieve those goals and we are working to ensure minimal impact while the reconstruction is under way.” A major reconstruction project at John F. Kennedy International Airport will keep one of the four runways closed through November 2019. The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey began work earlier this month on a $355 million reconstruction and extension of the 13L-31R runway and associated taxiways to increase peak capacity and improve safety conditions. “The Port Authority recognizes the need for infrastructure upgrades to improve the customer’s flight experience and to better maintain and operate our facilities and assets,” said Port Authority chairman Kevin O’Toole. “This project is critical to achieve those goals, and we are working to ensure minimal impact while the reconstruction is underway.” Also included in the project is the installation of new lights, signs, cables and navigational aids, bringing the runway in line with modern safety standards and the latest landing technology. The new high-speed taxiways will increase peak capacity by enabling aircrafts to more quickly exit the runway. The project is expected to create 3,340 jobs, resulting in $251.8 million in payroll wages and $608.6 million in total economic activity. “With this project, the Port Authority is moving to rebuild JFK’s last outdated runway. This reconstruction effort will transform Runway 13L-31R from a 150-foot-wide asphalt runway to a 200-foot-wide concrete runway that will extend its life expectancy by a factor of four and improve the safety of flight operations,\" said Port Authority executive director Rick Cotton. The Federal Aviation Administration has devised a plan to manage aircraft traffic while the runway is closed in an attempt to minimize the delays associated with the closing of a major runway which handles approximately one-third of all arrivals at JFK Airport. PORT AUTHORITY BEGINS $355 MILLION RECONSTRUCTION OF RUNWAY AT JOHN F. KENNEDY INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT Project will include expanding the 13L-31R runway and associated taxiways, to improve safety and increase peak period capacity Use of concrete in construction will extend runway’s useful life to 40 years, rather than 8-12 years with asphalt Starting this week and continuing through November 2019, one of four runways normally in use at John F. Kennedy International Airport is closing for reconstruction to ensure the long-term safety and viability of the runway, which is approaching the end of its useful life. The airport awarded the contract for the runway construction in November 2018 and the work commenced Monday. Runway 13L-31R will be closed for repaving that will widen the runway by 33 percent. The project will also allow the installation of new lights, signs, cables and navigational aids. Once completed, it will meet new safety standards and will incorporate the latest landing technology. The rehabilitation will also provide aircraft a solid concrete runway that is more resilient than asphalt and will increase the useful life of the runway by four times. In addition, the creation of new high-speed taxiways will enable aircraft to exit the runway more quickly allow the runway handle more aircraft per hour at peak periods. The reconstruction is projected to create 3,340 total job years, $251.8 million in payroll wages and $608.6 million in economic activity. The decision to use concrete as opposed to asphalt for the runway project will reduce the number of construction days and extend its useful life to 40 years, instead of the typical asphalt lifespan of eight to 12 years. “The Port Authority recognizes the need for infrastructure upgrades to improve the customer’s flight experience and to better maintain and operate our facilities and assets,” said Port Authority Chairman Kevin O’Toole. “This project is critical to achieve those goals, and we are working to ensure minimal impact while the reconstruction is under way.” “With this project, the Port Authority is moving to rebuild JFK’s last outdated runway. This reconstruction effort will transform Runway 13L-31R from a 150-foot-wide asphalt runway to a 200-foot-wide concrete runway that will extend its life expectancy by a factor of four and improve the safety of flight operations,\" said Port Authority Executive Director Rick Cotton. “The project also will advance and upgrade the antiquated electrical lighting system originally installed in 1993 to a more sophisticated and energy-efficient system. “With collaboration from our airline partners and the Federal Aviation Administration, the next eight months of continuous work on Runway 13L-31R will pay huge dividends in terms of operational safety and efficiency over the coming decades at JFK, as it represents the final phase of upgrading the four operational runways at the airport,” Cotton said. In a joint statement, the JFK terminal operators expressed support for the project. “The Port Authority has continued to work extensively with the airport community in preparation for the runway reconstruction, which will directly impact all terminals and airlines. All JFK terminal operators understand the importance of this critical runway work.” The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has developed a strategic plan to manage aircraft traffic while Runway 13L is closed. The FAA is studying runway configuration, aircraft traffic flow rates and aircraft traffic management strategies to maximize efficiency and reduce delays at JFK. During the next eight months, the Port Authority will have the Airport Operations Center (AOC) open around the clock as the focal point for communications between terminal operators, airlines, air traffic control, Customs & Border Protection and the Transportation Security Administration (TSA). Performance metrics will be monitored continuously, including arrival, departure and taxi times. Adjustments will be made to reduce delay and protect the customer experience. Runway 13L-31R is about 10,000 feet long and handles approximately one-third of arrivals at JFK, which has more than 61 million customers annually and more than 455,000 flights a year. Airplanes that fly into John F. Kennedy International Airport over areas west of Deer Park will fly no lower than 4,000 feet starting June 24, U.S. Rep. Tom Suozzi (D-Glen Cove) announced Monday.  Some planes are flying as low as 2,000 feet, exacerbating the issue of airplane noise that has worsened in recent years due to changing flight patterns and in recent months due to runway renovation, Suozzi said.  Additionally, planes more than 15 miles away from the airport will be required to remain at 3,000 feet when Kennedy Airport's less frequently used runway is out of service the congressman said.  There will also be increased runway rotation.  The altitude changes are an immediate partial remedy as area lawmakers continue to advocate for altered flight patterns, he said.  It came as a result of a meeting with Federal Aviation Administration representative, air traffic controllers, Port Authority representatives, air traffic controller representatives, Nassau County Executive Laura Curran and U.S. Rep. Kathleen Rice (D-Garden City).  \"This is..., I believe, a major victory for our communities,\" Souozzi said at a news conference in the Village of Old Brookville Monday morning.  \"is it everything we want? no.  What I also want to see happen in the future, and they're starting to look at this now, is more dispersal.\"  Airplane noise has affected the quality of life for Long Islanders in recent years, residents and officials say.  Communities such as Roslyn and Floral Park have noticed a considerable increase in air traffic as the FAA has started rolling out a modernized aviation system called NextGen.  NextGen narrowed the air traffic routes over Long Island, making them more parallel rather than V-shaped, Suozzi said.  A Kennedy Airport runway has also been closed for repaving since the first week of April, according to the Port Authority of New York & New Jersey, which has caused even more planes to fly in the new patterns, Suozzi said.  The work is scheduled to continue until November.  \"A lot of people who don't know this issue say, 'Oh, people should know if they move near an airport, they're going to have this problem,'\" Suozzi said.  \"We're 20 miles from an airport.\" Roslyn Heights resident Steve North said airplanes have made it hard for him to enjoy his home in recent months.  He normally sits in a gazebo in his yard when the weather is nice but has been unable to this year.  \"I close all the windows in my house, I turn on the air conditioning to make a little bit of white noise and I turn on the music...and it barely helps,\" he said. North has tracked flights over his home using airnoise.io, a website that allows users to access a plane's height when it is flying over a particular location, and he said he has found that many are between 1,500 and 2,000 feet above the ground.  New airplane altitude requirements are a good first step toward relief and an acknowledgement that this is a real issue affecting many communities, North said.  Roslyn Estates Mayor Paul Leone Peters attended the Monday news conference on behalf of his constituents, although only one has come to him about the issue, he said.  \"If you're doubling the height, you're significantly lowering the noise,\" he said.  Suozzi said getting help from the FAA authorities in Washington, D.C. has been a bust.  Since entering office in 2017 he has been unable to get a meeting with the chairman.  The regional authorities have been much more supportive, he said.  There is a possible solution to airplane flight problems over the skies of Long Island. Many residents have been complaining about an increase in excessive noise from the aircraft flying above their homes. As CBS2’s Reena Roy found out on Monday, there are things being done to fix the issue. It came with no warning, but didn’t need an introduction. Once the residents heard the noise, they said they knew it meant trouble. “It comes over every two minutes or less and it makes a lot of noise that the whole house shakes sometimes,” said Bob Cassandro of Old Brookville. “It’s really a torturous way to live, to be quite honest with you,” Malverne resident Elaine Miller said. Since the beginning of April, thousands of residents in both Nassau County and the western part of Suffolk County say they’ve been enduring a significant increase in plane traffic and noise above their homes, with many of the complaints coming from people who live more than 20 miles from John F. Kennedy Airport. “It has become unbearable, intolerable. It has changed our lives in a drastic was,” said Steve North of Roslyn Heights. Officials said it’s due to the redirection of flight arrivals while one of JFK’s four runways goes through a planned overhaul, and new technology that narrowed flight plans. “It was like this before. Now it’s a more narrow path. It’s more efficient, it’s faster. It’s all these great things, but the people that are caught in this narrow path are getting a lot more traffic,” Congressman Tom Suozzi said. On Monday, Suozzi addressed a new agreement made with the Federal Aviation Administration to increase the altitude of planes. He said starting June 24, planes west of Deer Park must fly at least 4,000 feet above homes, instead of 2,000. Also, flights over communities more than 15 miles from JFK must be conducted at 3,000 feet. The agreement will cover all 24 hours of the day and will be permanent. “A lot of people who don’t know this issue say, ‘Oh, people should know if they move near an airport that they are going to have this problem.’ We’re 20 miles away from the airport,” Suozzi said. Many CBS2 spoke with said the agreement won’t help with the number of planes flying above their homes, but added it’s a start. Jana Goldenberg took videos of planes flying right above her Jericho home. The changes are expected to help her, but she said she’s still concerned for others. “It’s not going to help every community. So the thing is, you can’t just help a couple communities,” Goldenberg said. U.S. Rep. Tom Suozzi says there's hope for Nassau County residents who have long complained of plane noise over their homes in places like Jericho, Roslyn, Williston Park and Old Brookville. There has been more air traffic above some homes because of ongoing construction at John F. Kennedy International Airport that has reduced the number of runways. As a result, planes have to take a specific flight route that narrows the path of choices. After being inundated with complaints, Suozzi says he and other officials met with the FAA in May to look for solutions to alleviate the noise. Starting Monday, June 24, planes west of Deer Park must now fly at 4,000 feet. Right now they're flying at 2,000 feet. FAA says the new rule will be in effect 24 hours a day. Some Nassau residents say they don't think the new plan will make a difference. The JFK runway that's under construction won't be completed until November. \"Its gotten worse over the last six months or so.\"  \"If you are under the flight path you are bombarded day-in and day-out\". \"Our once quiet communities of years ago are now being inundated on a regular basis by low flying aircraft on their way to landing at Kennedy Airport.\"  \"This new business about putting the planes at a higher altitude will cut down on noise but will not completely eliminate the problem.\"  Rep. Thomas Suozzi announced Monday that flights arriving to John F. Kennedy International Airport in Queens must follow new regulations to help reduce noise created by low-flying planes. Beginning next Monday, flights arriving to JFK will adhere to air traffic control-created rules that require planes to remain at higher altitudes until closer to arrival, Suozzi (D-Glen Cove) said. Long Island residents, especially those in southwest Nassau County, have long dealt with the effects of living near a busy, international airport. Residents have said they have noticed a marked increase in flight activity over their homes after JFK closed one of four runways for repair and rerouted flights to accommodate the closure. “I think that we’re off to a good start,” Old Brookville Mayor Bernie Ryba said. “This is tangible improvement.” Ryba was joined by mayors from the North Shore communities of North Hills, Roslyn Estates and Upper Brookville at a news conference about the results of negotiations with local air traffic control workers. All flights west of Deer Park must fly at a minimum of 4,000 feet in elevation compared with the current 2,000 or 3,000 feet, Suozzi said. Runways 22R and 22L are two of the runways used for arriving flights at JFK. The 22L runway sees much more traffic than 22R, Suozzi said. Under the new regulations, when 22R is not in use, flights must remain at minimum 3,000 feet in elevation until 15 miles or less from the airport. All regulations will be in place 24 hours a day indefinitely.  Representatives from the New York and New Jersey Port Authority, which oversees transit operations in the New York metro area, including JFK, were not immediately available for comment Monday. The changes should improve quality of life related to aircraft noise, Suozzi said. “Is it everything we want? No.”  In addition to construction-related rerouting, Suozzi also blames the Next Generation Air Transportation, or NextGen, system for an increase in air traffic noise. The technology, designed to make flying safer and more efficient, was implemented by the FAA in 2015 and rerouted many of JFK’s flights to follow one direct path over Long Island’s residential areas. Suozzi said a possible solution is dispersing flights traveling to JFK for more even distribution across runways, which could break up flight patterns and alleviate incessant aircraft noise for some communities. “If you are under that flight path, you are bombarded day in and day out,” Elaine Miller of Malverne said. Miller is a co-president of Plane Sense 4 Long Island, an organization that advocates for Long Island communities affected by heavy air traffic. Co-president Jana Goldenberg lives in Jericho. “I don’t think this is a fix,” Goldenberg said. “I don’t know why this is now a North Shore issue. This is a Long Island issue, this is a Queens issue and this should not just represent one small community.”  \"Studies prove and studies have shown that noise will lead to cardiovascular disease, depression, headaches.\" \"This is a Long Island issue, this is a Queens issue and this should not just represent one small community, this should be representing every community.\" \"The bottom line is these three things, starting on June 24 should have a significant improvement in the quality of life related to this noise. One, that they've got to be over 4,000 feet when west of Deer Park; two, they've got to be over 3,000 feet when 22R is not being utilized; and three, that its 24 hours a day.\" The Federal Aviation Administration has postponed a change that was intended to alleviate aircraft noise. U.S. Rep. Tom Suozzi announced a deal Monday with the FAA that would require planes to stay at higher altitudes over Long Island. But just a few days later, the agency reversed course, claiming the change has to be postponed so the matter can be studied. Lorie Bratt, of the group Plane Sense 4 LI, says the big announcement earlier this week was nothing but hot air from politicians and the FAA. But Suozzi points the finger squarely at aviation officials, writing: \"This is another example of how the broken bureaucracy of the FAA refuses to implement changes that actually help alleviate the air traffic noise problem faced by people on the ground.\" The new regulations were originally scheduled to go into effect on June 24. But now, the FAA has not said when or even if any changes will be made. The FAA declined an interview with News 12. Hear the airplanes flying over home. Its annoying.  Sometimes they fly low and I can feel the vibrations in my house as well. Thought they'd get a break from the nonstop noise. I think we're being ignored. I would have taken any, anything to let us know they were listening. I feel that they are not listening. Nuisance, constant. North Shore communities 20 miles or more from Kennedy Airport are hearing more noise from aircraft in the last several months.  Flight patterns have changed due to the NextGen effort to improve air-traffic safety nationwide, and because of construction at Kennedy that is expected to continue through November.  Now, the Federal Aviation Administration must take steps to quiet the skies particularly above communities nowhere close to the airport.  The solution is there.  Rep Thomas Suozzi worked with local FAA officials and air traffic control personnel to come up with regulations that would increase the minimum elevation of flights west of Deer Park from about 2,000 to 4,000 feet, and which would change altitude requirements when a key Kennedy runway is closed for landings.  Initially, those new rules were supposed to be in place this week.  But days after Suozzi announced the plan, the FAA put the breaks on it, saying the new rules \"require additional internal evaluation.\"  That could include an environmental review and additional assessments.  There can't be any more delays.  Suozzi and other elected officials should work with the FAA to address any last-minute concerns but make sure the review is completed quickly.  Meanwhile, more than two dozen other congressional representatives last week requested that the Government Accountability Office study how the FAA is assessing noise levels and communicating with the public during the NextGen project.  There are too many discrepancies between the FAA's findings and local concerns.  That's troubling and must be resolved.  With new guidelines and a better understanding of the community impacts, some quiet can be restored.\"\"\"\n",
