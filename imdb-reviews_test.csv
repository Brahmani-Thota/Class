"second two filmed ""Hamlets"" nineties, first Franco Zeffirelli's, starring Mel Gibson, 1990. Zeffirelli's version, like Laurence Olivier's 1948, based upon abridged version play, much Shakespeare's original text cut. (I never seen Tony Richardson's 1969 version, ran less two hours, shorter even Zeffirelli's, presume also abridged). Kenneth Branagh attempting something much ambitious- film based complete text play, running time around four hours.<br /><br />With ""Henry V"", Branagh claimed Olivier's crown cinema's leading Shakespearean, confirming claim brilliant ""Much Ado Nothing"", rare example great film based Shakespeare comedy. ""Hamlet"" third Shakespeare film director (he also acted Iago Oliver Parker's 1995 ""Othello"") and, one might expect, different ""Much AdoÂ ."". earlier film, shot villa hills Tuscany beautiful surrounding countryside, joyous, summertime film everything makes life worth living.<br /><br />""Hamlet"", contrast set depths winter. (The flowers description Ophelia's death suggest Shakespeare thought action happening summer). look film particularly striking, sumptuous chilly. filmed Blenheim Palace, possibly England's grandiose stately home, also rather forbidding one. snowy exterior scenes cold wintry; interior ones formal elaborate. action updated mid nineteenth century; female characters wear elaborate fashions era, principal male ones mostly wear splendid military uniforms. (There contrast Zeffirelli's film, interiors costumes deliberately subdued tone). play dominated images corruption decay; Branagh's intention may contrast splendid surface underlying ""something rotten state Denmark"".<br /><br />The film notable large number big-name actors, minor roles. (Blink, might miss John Gieldgud Judi Dench). Apparently, all-star cast required production company, nervous four-hour film. imported Hollywood stars, Robin Williams' Osric, really come off, others, like Charlton Heston's Player King Billy Crystal's First Gravedigger, played parts well. Yorick, normally seen skull, seen flashback, played British comedian Ken Dodd. Brian Blessed, often plays jovial characters, cast type Ghost, makes scenes appears genuinely frightening.<br /><br />Of major characters, perhaps weakest Kate Winslet's Ophelia. Branagh's leading lady first two Shakespeare films wife Emma Thompson, marriage ended divorce 1995. did, however, find wishing Thompson cast role; although Winslet came Ophelia's mad scenes, seemed weak earlier ones character still sane. (I preferred Helena Bonham Carter Zeffirelli's version). Richard Briers plays Polonius greater dignity often given, wise experienced counsellor rather prating old fool. Julie Christie also brings dignity role Gertrude; attempt here, Gibson Glenn Close Zeffirelli version, suggest incestuous attachment Hamlet. (An interpretation owes Freud Shakespeare). age difference Christie Branagh great enough credible mother son, certainly case Close Gibson. (Olivier's Gertrude, Eileen Herlie, was, bizarrely, thirteen years younger him).<br /><br />Branagh stated intention restoring scenes often cut cinematic versions ""reinforce idea play national well domestic tragedy."" Much stress placed upon war Norway Norwegian Prince Fortinbras- subplot ignored altogether Zeffirelli. emphasis national tragedy perhaps best shown character Claudius, sometimes played one-dimensional villain. something Derek Jacobi's performance suggests Claudius could good man different circumstances, allowed led astray ambition lust. could good loyal servant brother, chose rule bad king. Although tormented guilt, see way make amends evil done.<br /><br />Branagh, wonderfully fluent speaker Shakespeare's verse, superb main role. Like Gibson, little time old concept Hamlet indecisive, passive melancholy. active, physical, energetic Hamlet, something best shown fatal duel Laertes. guiding principle world-weary despair, active disgust evil corruption.<br /><br />It gamble Branagh make four-hour epic, film well box office. was, however, praised many critics, James Berardinelli particularly enthusiastic. opinion that, whatever financial returns may been, Branagh's gamble paid artistic terms. concentrating full text, able bring full meaning full emotional power Shakespeare's complex play. reviewed ""Much AdoÂ "", said greatest ever film Shakespeare comedy.

"Almost well done... ""John Carpenter's Vampires"" entertaining, solid piece popcorn-entertainment budget small enough overrun special effects. obviously aiming ""From Dusk Till Dawn""-audience.

Showed audience vampiress human past, suffering creature beast slaughtering anybody). that's point decides whether movie accepted audience original movie not. also: ""From Dusk Till Dawn""-audience really going like this? I'm sure that. Nevertheless Tommy Lee Wallace really great job, ""Vampires:Los Muertos"" surprisingly good. also think direct sequel popcorn movie Wallace sometimes almost creative, expressive. Like he's keeping developing talent order satisfy expectations audience. opinion, Wallace' talent fills movie life maybe sometimes sucking time. ""Vampires: Los Muertos"" almost well done.

Oh horrible prop teeth (then British actors, maybe REAL!!!) <br /><br />The second story tale lonely old man (Peter Cushing) moved escape loneliness, yet worsens haunted lost love. seems found possible salvation local (very creepy) wax museum, turns would much better alone.......<br /><br />The third story includes great Christopher Lee (my fav British horror actor) single father rather disturbed thoroughly creepy young daughter. constantly wary getting things shouldn't---like witchcraft! natural talent it, good reason. Lee superb ice cold disciplinarian, man true talent playing characters absolutely devoid warmth!! despite best efforts, little troublemaker fact learn forbidden knowledge bad things follow......<br /><br />This final story tale cynical old veteran actor feels young director he's working isn't qualified capture proper vampire film, right quality costumes cloak particular. goes old curiosity store middle foggy night get something ""authentic"".

Side Note: Make sure catch Lee Pitt along stunning Amicus star Britt Ekland time classic film Wicker Man (1973). <br /><br />The weakest link interlacing commentary stories, based stories themselves, classic! Objectively, would say third story best, like 4th makes smile much.Very highly recommended horror fans you're British horror fan, it's mandatory! I'd say it's worthwhile view series chronological order can. last film series, Monster Club (1980) certainly weakest. think first 3-4 films except times mediocre Torture Garden (1967) best, like them, watch least once.

"""anthology"" horror film. It's made 4 short stories taken fiction Robert Bloch (who wrote Weird Tales personal friends H.P. Lovecraft, famous original story ""Psycho""). quality stories uneven didn't think much film creepy horrific all. would better comedy like ""Comedy Terrors."" last 4 stories really done humorous way, it's probably best (the one Ingrid Pitt). I've seen Amicus anthology films one really worth time Freddie Francis' ""Tales Crypt."" anthology style works well producers, means hire bunch ""big name"" actors, employ one week shooting so, bring next big name. essentially pay 6 weeks movie star salary get 5 6 different names marquee. that's unfortunate audience, audience would like see scenes Peter Cushing, Christopher Lee, Ingrid Pitt actually acting together. Instead they're stuck vignettes themselves. let's take one time, briefly.<br /><br />The first story Denholm Elliot, really admirable job trying bring dignity silly role writer terrorized character. Unfortunately actor plays Dominic, source horror, Tom Adams, looks silly ruins possible horror. There's hilarious stuff want laugh though, like scene Dominic kills Elliot's psychiatrist. It's patented scene killer creeps behind victim nobody watching, whole audience supposed shout ""LOOK BEHIND YOU!"" second story one Peter Cushing. God love man much. bad many films, like one, pretty much stink. story he's supposed pining away long-lost love, sees likeness wax museum. It's completely predictable story goes nowhere.<br /><br />Then bit Christopher Lee, plays father little kid turns witch. bit could fun played laughs. instead we're supposed horrified Lee slaps child surprised turns evil. actress, Chloe Franks, pretty good type ""Bad Seed"" role though.<br /><br />The last story kind amusing... Ingrid Pitt plays actress Jon Pertwee plays actor accidentally buys vampire cape turns real vampire. That's story offer. surprised bad Ingrid Pitt's English is, guess must dubbed films I've seen in.<br /><br />Not memorable film one would recommend anyone horror completists.",0

"dug watched tonight. honestly think must 20 years since last time saw it. remember seriously flawed film. don't remember bad!!!!!<br /><br />I absolutely aghast project much potential mistreated reprehensibly. blame this? 2 guys wrote (and use word loosely) script? casting directors terribly miscast least 3 major characters story? (Only 2 among ""the amazing 5"".) director, clearly refused take seriously, kept shoving awful music top bad writing & bad acting everywhere? (I LIKED theme song-- never used way throughout entire film!) Don Black, ASHAMED lyrics wrote music?<br /><br />It figures pull out, less week re-reading comic-book adaptation. first 15-20 minutes film more-or-less (really, LESS) parallel first issue comic. watched tonight, kept wondering-- ALMOST every single detail changed? Doc showing up, using wrist-watch remote-control open safe, sniper's bullet missing 5 inches refractive glass, things left same. mean, you're gonna ""adaptation"", God's name change EVERYTHING???<br /><br />Once leave Doc's HQ, virtually NOTHING comic (which, given Roy Thomas, figure probably follows book). read somewhere actually combined elements 2 different novels one movie. Again-- WHY? I've heard changed weren't able secure kind budget wanted. look film, think... LACK MONEY WAY explains saw screen!!<br /><br />You know, people complain Joel Schumacher, really take look thing. best thing say is, think would make great double-feature 1966 BATMAN feature-- probably great triple-bill 1980 FLASH GORDON. 3 films ""silly"". Maybe ""blame"" 1966 film (and TV series) this. fans complained years Adam West's BATMAN ruined image comic-books minds generations non-comics fans. think could said Hollywood. I'm reminded many really, really BAD films based ""classic"" characters made years, especially (it seems me) late 70's & early 80's. Charlie Chan, Fu Manchu, Tarzan, Buck Rogers, Flash Gordon, Lone Ranger-- ""murdered"" Hollywood types think, ""OH, comic-books! know it's supposed STUPID!"" like they're ""stupid"" ones. waste potential.<br /><br />Let say good things... Despite script directing, Ron Ely GREAT. read DOC SAVAGE story, don't think James Bama paintings, think Ely. Bill Lucking (who later regular A-TEAM) terrific. Eldon Quick (who I've seen somewhere else, can't recall where) terrific. Paul Gleason-- absolutely HATED passion vengeance BREAKFAST CLUB (""teachers"" like one played banned ever teaching anywhere), may best ""amazing 5"" film. Pamela Hensley-- though part almost unrecognizable original story-- terrific. let hair down, also realized looked HELL lot like ""Ardala Valmar"" awful John Calkins BUCK ROGERS strips read day. She's got big nose like Ardala-- quite pronounced. comics Ardala actually looked like 1936 movie Princess Aura-- Cher. maybe Streisand. Take yer pick.

However, European Vacation sequel major let down.<br /><br />In sequel, Griswalds win European Vacation game show. problem many jokes film little mild, ""ha-ha"" laughs. example, Flight Attendant airplane asks Clark, ""Do want Coke Can?"" Clark answers back, ""No, I'll right here."" That's really line funny film.<br /><br />European Vacation's humor strained. writers borrowed jokes first movie, tried re-hash script done before, relied ridiculous slap-stick chase scene sequence toward end picture kill time.<br /><br />Worse, natural comic standouts like Randy Quaid Cousin Eddie original kids played Rusty Audrey first movie well nowhere found. replacements funny, can't act, look like going motions time. also crude sex jokes comments funny, bad taste.<br /><br />The Griswald's stayed Wally World. place made legends!

"2005,George W.

"2 stars Kay Francis -- she's wonderful! didn't deserve horrible tripe Warner Bros. threw way! <br /><br />The two-pronged premise movie based ridiculous unbelievable extreme. Kay small-town wife mother yearns something bigger: wants actress. big-shot actor comes town invites Kay hotel talk possibilities, Kay tells husband she's going movies. hubby's biddy mother puts bug hubby's ear Kay's truthful, sets looking her. finds w/ actor hotel (they talking!) slugs guy, falls railing, lands face-first pond (lake?), dies. here's two unbelievable premises upon rest movie based: <br /><br />1) judge tells jury it's determined man died *before* head went water, must find hubby guilty first degree murder. (Whaaaaa?????? think slugging guy fit rage would count manslaughter murder 2 most, FIRST DEGREE murder. Give break! plot required found guilty murder 1 could sent prison life. Whatever.) <br /><br />2) hubby's lawyer, conviction sentencing, tells Kay it's fault. reasoning hadn't gone actor's room, husband wouldn't go slug guy kill him. tells she's guilty one, husband, nods agrees. What. The. Hell?!?!?! rest movie Kay trying achieve fame money order get husband released prison right wrong committed causing kill actor dude first place.<br /><br />I can't even go review. movie painful. Four years earlier, pre-code days, you'd never caught Kay playing wimp! true Kay Francis fashion, though, best make us believe woman believable character. give much credit trying breathe life credibility thankless role. character far cry pre-code Kay roles real-life spitfire Kay Francis.<br /><br />Steer way clear one! much better Kay Francis vehicles there! (From personal experience, highly recommend Mary Stevens, MD Jewel Robbery; also good Dr. Monica One Way Passage. I'm sure there's great Kay flicks well, I'm mentioning ones I've seen recommend.)",0

Schumacher since given us ""The Phantom Opera"", ""Phone Booth"", ""A Time Kill"", two Batman movies, ""Batman Robin"" ""Batman Forever"" range good great directing. Something went wrong ""StEF"" genius whatsoever, comedy worth anything, far mark truly valuable life. <br /><br />Example: character Wendy (a rich little girl heart good help less fortunate played Mare Winningham ) reveals Billy (an unruly slob cheats wife girlfriends, drinks far much sense order life appropriately played Rob Lowe) still virgin.

Wendy, works social worker helping broken families, seems phased despot. Give break. one thing give once, gives loser leaving family friends?
